# WatsonUnityScriptableObject
IBM Watson and Unity3d demostration using Scriptable Objects

See Also Hackaday project https://hackaday.io/project/91321-watson-speech-ai-meets-unity-3d-scriptableobject

IBM Watson released a Unity 3D SDK for the Speech-to-Text and ToneAnalysis Services.
The demos in the SDK are thin, a more fleshed out demo was shown in YouTube (see hackaday project)
About the same time as I started working with Watson/Unity, I also discovered ScriptableObjects.
This project is an attempt to build a demo using ScriptableObject on top of the WatsonSDK.

Note that the IBM SDK requires MonoBehavior, so this is only a partial rebuild.
